The [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) Shelly Connector is an extension for the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem that enables seamless integration
with [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) devices. It allows users to easily connect and control [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) devices from within the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem,
providing a simple and user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring your devices.

# About Connector

This connector has some services divided into namespaces. All services are preconfigured and imported into application
container automatically.

```
\FastyBird\Connector\Shelly
  \API - Services and helpers related to API - for managing data exchange validation and data parsing
  \Clients - Services which handle communication with Shelly devices or clouds
  \Commands - Services used for user console interface
  \Entities - All entities used by connector
  \Helpers - Useful helpers for reading values, bulding entities etc.
  \Queue - Services related to connector internal communication
  \Schemas - {JSON:API} schemas mapping for API requests
  \Services - Communication services factories
  \Translations - Connector translations
  \Writers - Services for handling request from other services
```

All services, helpers, etc. are written to be self-descriptive :wink:.

> [!TIP]
To better understand what some parts of the connector meant to be used for, please refer to the [Naming Convention](Naming-Convention) page.

## Using Connector

The connector is ready to be used as is. Has configured all services in application container and there is no need to develop
some other services or bridges.

> [!TIP]
Find fundamental details regarding the installation and configuration of this connector on the [Configuration](Configuration) page.

> [!TIP]
The connector features a built-in physical device discovery capability, and you can find detailed information about device
discovery on the dedicated [Discovery](Discovery) page.

This connector is equipped with interactive console. With this console commands you could manage almost all connector features.

* **fb:shelly-connector:install**: is used for connector installation and configuration. With interactive menu you could manage connector and devices.
* **fb:shelly-connector:discover**: is used for direct devices discover. This command will trigger actions which are responsible for devices discovery.
* **fb:shelly-connector:execute**: is used for connector execution. It is simple command that will trigger all services which are related to communication with Shelly devices and services with other [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem services like state storage, or user interface communication.

Each console command could be triggered like this :nerd_face:

```shell
php bin/fb-console fb:shelly-connector:install
```

# Troubleshooting

## Discovery Issues

In some cases, [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) devices may not be discovered. This is usually due to issues with mDNS service. Each [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) device
sends out multicast information, but some routers or other network components may block this communication.
To resolve this issue, refer to your router's configuration and check if there are any blocks or configurations that may
be blocking mDNS service.

## Incorrect Mapping

The connector will attempt to map [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) devices to the correct channels and device properties, but there may be cases
where naming issues or incorrect data types occur. These issues can be corrected through the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) user interface.

# Known Issues and Limitations

Battery-powered devices are a special type of device and must be woken up (e.g. by pressing a button) in order for them
to be discovered by the connector.

Currently, generation 2 battery devices are not supported, but we are working to add support for them in the future.
